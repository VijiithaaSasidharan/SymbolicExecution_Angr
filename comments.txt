Grade: B+

You have used the angr tool to carry out binary analysis of the pwd command from Linux. This meets the specification of running a tool on a real software program. The issue here is that pwd is pretty solid these days and you're unlikely to actually find something, so you formulated three properties and verified them. Unfortunately you did not include the original pwd.c file to easily see how you inserted the properties. The first property checks that opendir doesn't subsequently return NULL. You need to say that you check opendir with the same parameter. And it's not necessarily true that, for arbitrary values of its parameters, it won't return NULL: there could be a race condition. For the second property, you check something that can't possibly fail. And it's not at all clear what the third property is (be more explicit). You also tried angr with some specially-constructed benchmarks to check that it worked.
